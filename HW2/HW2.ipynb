The player receives points according to the number of fruits eliminated.\n",

This is due to the fact that `count(r1, r2, rows, height)` is called many times for the same values `r1`, `r2`, `height`. To solve the problem, it is enough to store in a table the `quadruplet (r1, r2, height, count(r1, r2, rows, height))` the first time we calculate `count(r1, r2, rows, height)` (the value of rows never changes, so it is not necessary to store it). The following times, we will directly fetch the information (here the number of grids associated with `r1`, `r2` and `height`) from the table without recalculating the value. We could use the Java `HashMap` class to create such a table. However, in order to fully understand the principle of this data structure, we will start by creating a hash table ourselves."
